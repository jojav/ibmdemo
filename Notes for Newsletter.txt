Heritage Foundation, recommendations
he Heritage Foundation has long advocated for a voucher program, known as Education Savings Accounts. This faux blue ribbon report advises that public money should be taken from the public schools to allow parents to shop for education services, and that
 schools be allowed to hire uncertified teachers.
At the same time, numerous
 television ads for the for-profit K12 online schools and Pearson's Connections Academy are popping up on CNN.
in short, those who
 would privatize our public schools are attempting to capitalize on a national health and economic crisis.

Harrowing Happiness
Cooped up for a long-awaited delivery, Saturday's TV-lunch briefly took me back to the future with a certain groovy 70’s, ornithological family, and infomercials.  Franky The Broom was at it again with that bear-flag-thing! Will anybody actually “act now” using “easy payments...of $19.95” to buy Pawvana, Kewbee, Dust-Papi, OxEpyur, or Powerthighs?”  If you have time to work on a beachbody, just text Carl--it's free, but so is Prosvent.  And off goes the TV.
As corollary, the avian group made me wonder: will the collective powers-that-be espouse “...there’s a song that we’re singing, c'mon get happy!”?  Buget cuts outlined HERE indicate elsewise, but teachers will be happy to know that raises and retro are in tact while everything else is not.  Some happiness may be found with new data HERE suggesting CV19 is flattening.
